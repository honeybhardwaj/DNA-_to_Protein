## Project Description

Write a computer program in any scripting language of your choice to convert a DNA
sequence assigned to you (available in .fasta format; refer to the appendix) into protein
sequence considering the following mandatory requirements:
- The minimum length of protein should be 44 (containing 44 amino acids).
- There is no limit on maximum length of protein.
- If a file with wrong format is given then it should throw a message ‚Äúinput file is not in .fasta
format‚Äù (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format)
- If a file with non DNA characters is given it should throw a message ‚Äúinput file does not
contain DNA sequence data‚Äù

Your submission should contain your code along with following information in .txt/.doc/.pdf:
1) Total number of proteins found
2) Number of proteins found under the following sequence length:
- 44-100
- 100-500
- 500-Beyond
